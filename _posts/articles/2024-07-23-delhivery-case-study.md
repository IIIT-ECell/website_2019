## Intro

As the sun dipped low over Gurugram, Haryana, Suraj Saharan found himself deep in thought within the glass-walled headquarters of Delhivery. It was a moment of reflection on the remarkable journey that Delhivery had undertaken since its humble beginnings. From its roots as a restaurant food delivery service, Delhivery has blossomed into India's largest integrated 3rd Party Logistics Service Provider.

Suraj's mind wandered back to the early days when Delhivery ventured into the e-commerce sector with a mission to revolutionize logistics. Faced with challenges like delayed cash cycles and tedious processes, Delhivery embarked on a path of innovation. Today, it stands tall, offering a plethora of services including express parcel delivery, partial and full-truck loading, cross-border supply chain, and warehousing.

With its unwavering commitment to efficiency and customer satisfaction, Delhivery has become synonymous with reliability and excellence in the logistics industry, servicing every pin code in the country with the lowest cost network. As the competition intensifies, Delhivery stands ready to face the challenges ahead and continue its journey of success.

## Founding Story:

The founding story of Delhivery is a tale of entrepreneurial vision and adaptability, rooted in the vibrant landscape of India's burgeoning e-commerce industry. It all began with Sahil Barua's entrepreneurial aspirations during his time at IIM Bangalore, where he envisioned a Thrasio-style model to assist startups in scaling up their operations.

The Indian e-commerce revolution had its modest beginnings with online ticket bookings by the Indian Railways in 2002. However, the true turning point came with Flipkart's entry into online book sales in 2007. As the industry evolved, embracing various models like B2C marketplaces and inventory-led platforms, logistics emerged as the linchpin enabling its expansion. Flipkart's introduction of Cash on Delivery (CoD) in 2010 ignited unprecedented growth, transforming the online shopping experience for millions of Indians.

In this dynamic landscape, Delhivery was born in 2010, founded by Sahil Barua and Suraj Saharan. Initially serving as a last-mile delivery partner for local eateries, Delhivery quickly recognized the potential of e-commerce and pivoted to align itself with emerging online platforms like Urbantouch and Healthkart.

Delhivery's journey took off rapidly. By the end of 2011, its shipment volumes surged, underscoring its pivotal role in India's e-commerce ecosystem. The introduction of CoD brought both challenges and opportunities, prompting Delhivery to innovate and ensure smooth transactions and customer satisfaction.

### Delhivery IPO

Delhivery initially planned a significant $1 billion IPO in October 2021 but decided to scale it down to $750 million due to market uncertainties and geopolitical factors. Despite aiming for a $5 billion valuation, the company faced challenges due to the aftermath of LIC's mega IPO, leading to a tepid response during its subscription period.

Upon opening on May 11, 2022, Delhivery's IPO witnessed a lukewarm start with only 21% subscriptions on the first day and a modest increase to 23% by the end of the second day. However, the shares debuted at a premium, listing higher than the issue price, and continued to gain momentum on both the BSE and NSE.

Despite the subdued market sentiment, Delhivery's IPO marked a significant milestone as it became the first tech startup to go public in a season dominated by negative sentiment towards public listings. Notably, major investors like Softbank and Times Internet capitalized on the event, with Softbank selling a portion of its stakes and achieving over 148% ROI, while Times Internet garnered substantial returns by divesting some of its shares.

Ultimately, Delhivery's successful listing underscored investor confidence in the company's prospects, with its valuation reaching $4.77 billion by the end of the listing day, further solidifying its position in the logistics sector.

### Delhivery Partnerships

Delhivery has forged numerous significant partnerships, including a collaboration with Volvo in August 2020. This partnership aimed to integrate tractor-trailers into Delhivery's express network, marking a pioneering move in the field of express trucking. Sahil Barua, Co-Founder of Delhivery, emphasized the strategic importance of this initiative, highlighting its role in bolstering the company's network expansion efforts and reinforcing its leadership position in the market.

Furthermore, Delhivery solidified its partnership with FedEx Express through a strategic alliance transaction initiated in July and finalized on December 9, 2021. This alliance is poised to amalgamate Delhivery's extensive pan-India network and cutting-edge technology solutions with FedEx's global network prowess. The synergistic collaboration is expected to deliver unparalleled benefits to customers, combining the strengths of both entities to offer enhanced services and solutions.

## Challenges

Delhivery encounters a myriad of challenges in the dynamic landscape of logistics and e-commerce. These challenges include:

1. **Handling logistic operations in rural areas:** Delivering parcels to remote and rural locations poses logistical challenges such as limited infrastructure, connectivity issues, and last-mile delivery challenges.
2. **Engaging and retaining customers:** In a competitive market, retaining customers and ensuring their satisfaction is crucial. Delhivery must continuously strive to provide excellent service to retain its customer base.
3. **Adhering to food quality standards:** As Delhivery expanded its services to include food delivery, ensuring food quality and adhering to food safety standards becomes paramount to maintain customer trust and satisfaction.
4. **Managing customer expectations:** Meeting the diverse expectations of customers regarding delivery times, product quality, and customer service can be challenging, requiring Delhivery to maintain high service standards consistently.
5. **Dealing with damaged items during delivery:** Despite best efforts, instances of damaged items during transit may occur, requiring Delhivery to implement effective processes for handling and resolving such issues promptly.
