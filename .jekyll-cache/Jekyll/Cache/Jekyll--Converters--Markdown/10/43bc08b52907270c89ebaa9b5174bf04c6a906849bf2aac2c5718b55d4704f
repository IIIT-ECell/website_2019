<p>Blockchain networks rely on one thing above all others for security: The generation of unpredictable, non-manipulable, verifiable randomness. This is used to select a block maker, build a wall of security, and in future platforms, assign special roles to network participants. 
This talk was a quick introduction to randomness generation, covering Proof of Work (Bitcoin), Commit &amp; Reveal (Ethereum - Proof of Stake, Tezos), and DFINITY‚Äôs verifiable random function, Threshold Relay.</p>
