            <h4>We realise that we need to associate ourselves with great companies to
                grow and reach more and more people. With this aim in mind, each year we conduct 
                many events which aim at bringing the students closer to the industry so that they 
                come up with their own unique solutions to the problems in each sector. All these 
                events do require a lot of funding to be successful. 
                It is our sponsors who help us in our endeavours not only monetarily but also 
                with their experience. If you would like to sponsor us, reach out to us at 
                <a href="mailto:ecell@iiit.ac.in">ecell@iiit.ac.in</a>   
                We would love to hear back from you.
